In this article, we're going to explore different ways of creating customizable components in SwifUI.

Many of us have encountered loader indicators in our work, making it a familiar starting point. We'll begin with the most basic component and progressively enhance its flexibility.

Imagine a basic circle that fills up as the progress increases. This is our starting point:

```swift
struct LoaderView: View {

    let progress: Double
    @State private var degree: Double = 0

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .trim(from: 0.0, to: progress)
            .stroke(Color.red, style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: 8.0, lineCap: .round))
            .rotationEffect(.degrees(degree))
            .animation(Animation.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: false), value: degree)
            .onAppear {
                degree = 360
            }
            .frame(width: 80, height: 80)
    }
}
```

_It spins and spins all the time, nothing more._

### Progress color

Let's start the improvements by making the progress color adjustable.  Initially, you might consider passing a tint color directly into the initializer:

```swift
LoaderView(progress: 0.6, tintColor: .purple)
```

However, having numerous configuration parameters can get messy eventually, so I'd suggest to use a more SwiftUI approach - using the `tint` modifier:

```swift
LoaderView(progress: 0.6)
    .tint(.purple)
```

If you are used to using environments, you may want to consider using `@Environment(\.tint)`.  
But the problem it doesn't exist (technically it's internal), so we can't access it directly.

```swift
struct LoaderView_Env: View {
    // Error: 'tint' is inaccessible due to 'internal' protection level
    @Environment(\.tint) var tint
}
```

By looking at the `stroke` signature we can see it accepts [ShapeStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapestyle) protocol as a first argument, not a specific color as we might though:

```swift
func stroke<S>(_ content: S, style: StrokeStyle, antialiased: Bool) -> ... where S : ShapeStyle
```

The nice thing for us is that SwiftUI provides [TintShapeStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/tintshapestyle) that conforms that protocol and has an underlying access to the passed tint color.
Thus, we don't need an environment at all, just pass `.tint` as an argument:

 ```swift
.stroke(.tint, style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: 8.0, lineCap: .round))
```

**NOTE:** the similar approach can be achieved for `.foreground` by using `ForegroundStyle`.

### Loader size

Now the color is configured, let's make the loader view flexible in size. 

With the current implementation it has a fixed size 80x80. To adjust this, we set the ideal size - similar to `intrinsicContentSize` in UIKit:

```swift
Circle()
    ...
    .frame(idealWidth: 80, idealHeight: 80)
```

By default our loader grows as long as a parent allows, but if we want to have a default size - we apply `fixedSize` modifier:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 20) {
            LoaderView(progress: 0.6)
                .fixedSize()

            LoaderView(progress: 0.6)
        }
    }
}
```

You can experiment with the `Color` the same way - it expands as much as possible and the `fixedSize` makes tiny.

_If you're not familiar with these modifiers, I'd recommend to read this article about [SwiftUI Layout](https://betterprogramming.pub/swiftui-layout-the-mystery-of-size-b82ce99e61d8)._

So far so good:

```swift
struct LoaderView: View {

    let progress: Double
    @State private var degree: Double = 0

    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .trim(from: 0.0, to: progress)
            .stroke(.tint, style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: 8.0, lineCap: .round))
            .rotationEffect(.degrees(degree))
            .animation(Animation.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: false), value: degree)
            .onAppear {
                degree = 360
            }
            .frame(idealWidth: 80, idealHeight: 80)
    }
}
```

### Styling

It's time to add different styling options - for simplicity, we'll consider two variants: 
- _Primary_ (80x80 size, purple progress color, and progress value inside)
- _Secondary_ (40x40, pink, without any progress text)

In a simple scenario you'd just pass a `style` directly to an initializer:

```swift
LoaderView(style: .primary)
```

and applied different configurations for each style by having many `switch` and `if` conditions. Probably in most cases it's not a big deal and doesn't look messy, but sometimes it complicates the code a lot that it's better to use the approach SwiftUI uses [a lot](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view-styles) (style protocol).

First step is creating a `LoaderStyle` and `LoaderStyleConfiguration`. Different styles should implement this protocol and use the provided values by configuration: 

```swift
protocol LoaderStyle: DynamicProperty {
    typealias Configuration = LoaderStyleConfiguration
    associatedtype Body: View

    @ViewBuilder func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> Body
}
```

It's up to you how many information your configuration's needed. For simplicity the progress and the loader bar will be enough for us: 

```swift
struct LoaderStyleConfiguration {
    struct Indicator: View {
        public let body: AnyView
    }

    let progress: Double
    let loadingIndicator: Indicator

    init(progress: Double, @ViewBuilder loadingIndicator: @escaping () -> some View) {
        self.progress = progress
        self.loadingIndicator = Indicator(body: AnyView(loadingIndicator()))
    }
}
```

Then we need to define a custom `EnvironmentKey` with the default **primary** option for passing a needed style to our component:

```swift
struct LoaderStyleEnvironmentKey: EnvironmentKey {
    static var defaultValue: any LoaderStyle = PrimaryLoaderStyle()
}

extension EnvironmentValues {
    var loaderStyle: any LoaderStyle {
        get { self[LoaderStyleEnvironmentKey.self] }
        set { self[LoaderStyleEnvironmentKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}

extension View {
    func loaderStyle(_ style: any LoaderStyle) -> some View {
        environment(\.loaderStyle, style)
    }
}
```

Finally, two implementations of our styles: 

```swift
struct PrimaryLoaderStyle: LoaderStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.loadingIndicator
            .tint(Color.purple)                        
            .frame(width: 80, height: 80)
            .overlay {
                Text(String(Int(configuration.progress * 100)) + "%")
                    .font(.subheadline)
                    .foregroundStyle(Color.secondary)
            }
    }
}

struct SecondaryLoaderStyle: LoaderStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.loadingIndicator
            .tint(Color.red)
            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
    }
}
```

I also highly recommend to add some readability improvements by adding convenience getters for our styles:

```swift
extension LoaderStyle where Self == PrimaryLoaderStyle {
    static var primary: Self {
        PrimaryLoaderStyle()
    }
}

extension LoaderStyle where Self == SecondaryLoaderStyle {
    static var secondary: Self {
        SecondaryLoaderStyle()
    }
}
```

To make it all works we need to adjust our main component as well. Create a configuration with a progress and loading indicator and pass it to the loader style:

```swift
struct LoaderView: View {

    let progress: Double

    @State private var degree: Double = 0
    @Environment(\.loaderStyle) private var loaderStyle

    var body: some View {
        let configuration = LoaderStyleConfiguration(
            progress: progress,
            loadingIndicator: {
                Circle()
                    .trim(from: 0.0, to: progress)
                    .stroke(.tint, style: StrokeStyle(lineWidth: 8.0, lineCap: .round))
                    .rotationEffect(.degrees(degree))
                    .animation(Animation.linear(duration: 1).repeatForever(autoreverses: false), value: degree)
                    .frame(idealWidth: 80, idealHeight: 80)
                    .onAppear {
                        degree = 360
                    }
            }
        )
        let resolvedView = loaderStyle.makeBody(configuration: configuration)
        AnyView(resolvedView)
    }
}
```

Finally we can use it as follows:

```swift
VStack(spacing: 40) {
    LoaderView(progress: 0.6)
        .loaderStyle(.secondary)
    
    LoaderView(progress: 0.6)
        .loaderStyle(.primary)
}
```

Sure, you don't have to stick to all the rules for every single component. So, just use this know-how wisely and don't make your code more complicated than it needs to be. ðŸ˜‰
